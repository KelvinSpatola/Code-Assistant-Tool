# Code Assistant tool for the Processing Development Environment

This repository is no longer being developed. This project grew in scale, being reconfigured to become a Processing 'mode'. It's now called 'SmartCode' and you can follow its development repository [here](https://github.com/KelvinSpatola/SmartCode). 

Thank you.
